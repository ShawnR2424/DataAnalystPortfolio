This Python code simulates a trading algorithm used to trade stocks using only simple moving averages - a common strategy for traders to employ. I am using the datetime, matplotlib, and pandas_datareader packages to extract and analyze stock data from the web.

Data source: Yahoo API tracking real-time stock data for each ticker.
