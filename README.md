# Data Analyst Portfolio

This repository is used to store projects I have done to further education and experience in data analytics. Each folder will contain the metadata, raw data, project code, and/or final visualizations per each project. Any certifications will also be included in its own folder.

Software used include Anaconda (Python distribution) and Jupyter Notebook for publishing.
